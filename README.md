- Play Roblox in **windowed fullscreen** (not true fullscreen).
- Set your Roblox camera mode to **Default (Classic)**.
- Put “Recall Wrench” in the **2nd hotbar slot**—macro may bug out otherwise.
- Have at least **5–10 items in your hotbar** for best performance.
- **REMOVE SHIFT-LOCK!**
- Turn **UI Navigation** ON in your Roblox settings.
- If you have the **“grey mouse” pet** equipped, unequip it (it can break the macro due to speed boost).

## How to Set Up Your Own Discord Webhook

1. **Create a Webhook in Discord:**  
   Go to your Discord server → channel settings → Integrations → Webhooks → *New Webhook*. Copy your webhook URL.

2. **Add Your Webhook to the Macro:**  
   - Open the `.ahk` file in Notepad.
   - At the top, find the line:
     ```ahk
     url := "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1391942721949667378/PRe6FQy8se0_uCpj1kBM9tbXxfsyzmGANtJFCtUwd2qIt22QjBls1ChuTLB-dckfDzqz"
     ```
   - Replace the link inside the quotes with your own Discord webhook URL.
   - Save the file.

That’s it—now every time the macro does something big, you’ll get a ping in your server.

2. Open the macro’s GUI to change hotkeys, settings, or item selections.
